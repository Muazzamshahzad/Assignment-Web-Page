<p class="intro">“Teach online and earn money” sounds fascinating, isn’t it? Well, the teaching profession has always been regarded as boring and nerdy, but who knew this nerdy job can bring you a decent amount of money.

5. E-Commerce.

<p class="intro">Ecommerce is officially defined as commercial transactions conducted electronically over the internet (ya know, electronic commerce). 

In other words, ecommerce is simply the buying or selling of anything online. 

From physical goods like T-shirts, pie tins, and hermit crab huts, to services such as online courses and consulting, to digital goods like software and ebooks, ecommerce is the word that sums up online buying or selling.<br>There are a variety of ecommerce models, including:
<br>
Making and Selling This model is just what it sounds like. You own the entire product and brand by making your own products and selling them through your own store.
<br>

Working with a Manufacturer Have a great idea but aren’t able to produce it yourself? This is the model for you. Work with a supplier to make the product you have in mind, then sell through your online shop.<br>


Wholesaling/warehousing Curate and buy great products, store the inventory, and sell the goods through your online store for a bit of a profit. You have total say over which products you sell, but you do have to buy them upfront.  
<br>

Dropshipping This method puts your store as a sort of middleman between consumer and supplier. Sell products from a variety of suppliers without ever having to buy products upfront or store loads of inventory. Once an order is placed, the supplier handles the fulfillment and shipping.
